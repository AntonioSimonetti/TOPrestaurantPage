**Project: Restaurant Page**

*Simple implementation of restaurant page from The Odin Project curriculum.*

LIVE VERSION: 


The benefits I got:

- Learned how module(import and export) works and organizing better my code in more files(modules).
- Learned how webpack core works and how to use it.

**Good things to look at:**

- I was very fast on developing this project. I was very sure on how I had to develop this and I do not wasted time on designing frontend, because I have to focus more on be fast and go on in my journey, matter of fact, the page isn't looking great, but thats ok because this isnt the goal for this project.
